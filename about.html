                <p>When the Native Rose Hotel first opened in 1878, the suburb of Rozelle didn’t even exist.
                    It would be 14 years before the new Balmain West Post Office would be renamed Rozelle
                    (named after the abundant Rosella parrots found in the area), and another couple of decades
                    before the locals would formally adopt the name for the suburb. While there’s now no shortage of traditional
                    Australian pubs in Rozelle and surrounds, the Native Rose stands out as it has transformed through the years into the friendly local pub everyone dreams of.
